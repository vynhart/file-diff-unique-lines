# File Diff Unique Lines

Compare two open files and see which lines exist only in one of them.

## Usage

1. Open two files side by side
2. Run `Compare Unique Lines Between Two Files` from the Command Palette
3. See the unique lines displayed in a new editor tab

No settings, no fluff â€” just useful diffing.
